@TODO

- [x] Improve error UI:
   • Display "Network error" when the app is offline
   • Display "403 – Incorrect password" when it's an authentication error

- [x] Allow editing a bucket when one of its fields (password, etc.) is incorrect:
   • Allow password modification
   • Secure the display of the old password (biometric authentication / phone unlock)

- [x] "Back" button: only go back one level in navigation, not directly to the bucket list

- [x] When opening an object, retrieve and display a signed URL

- [x] Add a "Multiple Selection" mode to choose multiple objects and apply an action to them (delete, move)

- [x] "Object" view:
   • Display more metadata
   • Allow renaming and deleting the object

- [x] Main screen: display only one line per bucket
   Host (e.g. Hetzner) — BucketName (Location) + "Delete" button

- [x] "Add S3 bucket" screen: make the storage type selection more visible

- [x] Replace the current location list with a dropdown menu

- [x] Do the same for AWS region selection
