# Multiple Selection and Delete Fix Report

## Issue Description
The user reported that multiple selection and delete functionality was not working properly in their React Native S3 file manager app. Specifically:
- Individual delete (red button) works correctly
- Multiple selection and batch delete doesn't work

## Analysis of Problems Found

### 1. Incorrect Delete Method for Folders
**Problem**: The `handleDeleteSelected` function was calling `deleteObject()` for all selected items, regardless of whether they were files or folders.

**Impact**: Folders require special handling using `deleteFolder()` which recursively deletes folder contents.

**Solution**: Modified the batch delete logic to check if each item is a folder and call the appropriate delete function:
```typescript
if (objectToDelete?.isFolder) {
  await deleteFolder(provider, bucketName, key);
} else {
  await deleteObject(provider, bucketName, key);
}
```

### 2. Poor Error Handling
**Problem**: Generic error handling that masked specific deletion failures.

**Impact**: Users couldn't identify which items failed to delete or why.

**Solution**: Implemented individual error tracking for each deletion with detailed feedback:
- Track successful vs failed deletions separately
- Provide specific error messages for partial failures
- Continue processing even if some deletions fail

### 3. State Management Issues
**Problem**: Selected keys and multi-select mode weren't being properly cleared on errors.

**Impact**: UI could get stuck in inconsistent states after failed operations.

**Solution**: Ensured state cleanup happens in all scenarios (success, partial failure, complete failure).

### 4. Lack of Debugging Information
**Problem**: No logging to help diagnose selection and deletion issues.

**Impact**: Difficult to troubleshoot when things go wrong.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive logging for:
- Selection state changes
- Multi-select mode toggles
- Deletion process tracking
- Error details for each failed operation

## Code Changes Made

### Enhanced Error Handling in `handleDeleteSelected()`
- Added individual try-catch blocks for each deletion
- Track deletion success/failure counts
- Provide detailed user feedback based on results
- Ensure state cleanup in all scenarios

### Improved Selection Logic
- Added logging to track selection state changes
- Better feedback on delete button (shows count)
- More robust state management

### Better User Experience
- Delete button now shows selected count: "Supprimer la s√©lection (3)"
- More specific success/error messages
- Partial success handling with informative alerts

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Multiple Selection**: Users can toggle multi-select mode and see checkboxes
2. **Selection Tracking**: Selected items are properly tracked and displayed
3. **Batch Deletion**: Multiple items (files and folders) can be deleted simultaneously
4. **Error Handling**: Clear feedback on which operations succeeded/failed
5. **State Management**: UI properly returns to normal state after operations

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test selecting multiple files and deleting them
2. Test selecting multiple folders and deleting them
3. Test mixed selection (files + folders) and deletion
4. Test error scenarios (network issues, permission problems)
5. Verify UI state is properly reset after operations
6. Check console logs for debugging information

## Additional Improvements Made

- Enhanced user feedback with success/failure counts
- Better button labeling with selected item count
- Comprehensive error logging for troubleshooting
- Proper cleanup of selection state in all scenarios
