# Object Details Enhanced Features

## Overview
I've successfully implemented the requested features for the Object Details screen in your React Native S3 client app. The enhancements focus on improving the user experience for viewing, copying, and sharing object information.

## New Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Full Key Path Display
- **Improved UI**: The full path is now displayed in a dedicated container with a monospace font for better readability
- **Selectable Text**: Users can select the path text directly for manual copying
- **Better Formatting**: Multi-line support for long paths with proper line height

### 2. Copy Full Path Functionality
- **Copy Button**: Added a dedicated copy icon button next to the "Full Path" label
- **Clipboard Integration**: Uses `expo-clipboard` for reliable clipboard operations
- **User Feedback**: Shows confirmation alert when path is successfully copied
- **Error Handling**: Displays error message if clipboard operation fails

### 3. Native Share Link Feature
- **Share Button**: New share button alongside the open button in a row layout
- **Native Sharing**: Uses `expo-sharing` to integrate with native Apple sharing functionality
- **Signed URL Generation**: Generates temporary signed URLs for secure sharing
- **Fallback Support**: If native sharing is unavailable, falls back to copying the URL to clipboard
- **Loading States**: Shows loading indicator while generating share URLs

### 4. UI/UX Improvements
- **Better Button Layout**: Action buttons (Open and Share) are now in a horizontal row for better space usage
- **Consistent Icons**: Added meaningful icons to all buttons (open-in-new, share, pencil, delete, content-copy)
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Improved styling with better colors and spacing
- **Error Display**: Centralized error message display with consistent styling

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added
- `expo-clipboard`: For reliable clipboard operations across iOS and Android
- `expo-sharing`: For native system sharing integration

### Key Functions Added
1. **`handleCopyPath()`**: Copies the full object path/key to clipboard
2. **`handleShareLink()`**: Generates signed URL and shares via native system

### Styling Enhancements
- `pathContainer`: Dedicated styling for path display area
- `pathHeader`: Flex layout for path label and copy button
- `pathValue`: Monospace font for better path readability
- `actionButtonsRow`: Horizontal layout for primary action buttons
- `shareButton`, `deleteButton`: Consistent button styling

## Usage Examples

### Copy Path
1. User opens object details
2. Clicks the copy icon next to "Full Path"
3. Receives confirmation that path was copied
4. Can paste the full S3 object path anywhere

### Share Link
1. User opens object details for a file (not folder)
2. Clicks the "Share" button
3. System generates a temporary signed URL
4. Native iOS share sheet appears with options to:
   - Share via Messages, Mail, AirDrop, etc.
   - Copy to clipboard
   - Save to Notes
   - Any installed sharing apps

### Path Display
- Long paths wrap to multiple lines
- Text is selectable for manual copying
- Monospace font makes paths easier to read
- Clear visual separation from other object properties

## Cross-Platform Compatibility
- All features work on both iOS and Android
- Native sharing integrates with platform-specific sharing mechanisms
- Fallback behavior ensures functionality even if native sharing is unavailable
- Clipboard operations work reliably across platforms

## Security Considerations
- Signed URLs are temporary (5-minute expiration by default)
- URLs are generated only when needed (on-demand)
- No permanent public URLs are created
- User must have valid S3 credentials to generate share links
